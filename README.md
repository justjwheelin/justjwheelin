  <h1>Hi there.</h1>
</div>

My name is Justin (pronouns: _he/him_) and I am a creative maker.
I am best known as an Open Source contributor and Free Culture advocate originally from the United States.
I have participated in numerous Open Source communities and led different initiatives to build sustainable software and communities for over ten years.

In October 2022, I joined [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) as the fourth [**Fedora Community Architect**](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fca/) (F.C.A.).
I work closely between the Fedora Project community and Red Hat to lead initiatives to grow the Fedora user and developer communities and to make Red Hat & Fedora interactions even more transparent and positive.

Previous to Red Hat, from June 2020 to September 2022, I supported the [UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/) as the first **Open Source Technical Advisor**.
At UNICEF, I supported the [UNICEF Venture Fund](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/) and other Open Source activities within the Office of Innovation.
Together with a team of mentors, I mentored twenty-three start-up companies of diverse start-up companies from nineteen countries and five continents.
Of these companies, fourteen achieved global recognition as Digital Public Goods and three were acquired in multi-million dollar acquisitions.
Additionally, I designed a fixed-term Open Source community mentoring program for start-up companies and developer communities that later expanded to Technical Assistance programs run by other mentors for software development and data science & A.I.
