  <h1>Hi there.</h1>
</div>

My name is Justin (pronouns: _he/him_) and I am a creative maker.
I am best known as an open source contributor and Free Culture advocate originally from the United States.
I have participated in numerous open source communities and led different initiatives to build sustainable software and communities for nearly ten years.

In June 2020, I joined the [UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/) as their **Open Source Technical Advisor**.
There, I support the [UNICEF Venture Fund](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/) and other open source activities within the Office of Innovation.
I support and mentor cohorts of diverse start-up companies from five continents.
At the Venture Fund, I provides hands-on technical mentorship, support and mentorship, metrics assessments, and guidance on sustainability for growing open source communities.

I am also a contributor to [Fedora Linux](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/) since 2014.
Nowadays, I focus on community and documentation.
In the past, I volunteered as the team leader of the [Community Operations](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/) team for four years and was a founding member of the [Diversity and Inclusion Team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/diversity-inclusion/).
I also represented Fedora internationally at events and conferences, including [FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/storytelling/), [DevConf CZ](https://devconf.info/cz), [All Things Open](https://allthingsopen.org/talk/what-open-source-and-j-k-rowling-have-in-common/), [OSCAL](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/), and others.
